# Breast-Cancer-Tumor-Malignancy


Here I have used K-Nearest Neighbours and Logistic Regression Machine learning Algorithms to predict if the Tumor is Malignant or not.

Data has following 6 attributes:
+ BI-RADS
+ Age
+ Shape
+ Margin
+ Density
+ Severity

I am using algorithms to test severity of these tumors.(Malignant or Benign).

To know more about the data.
